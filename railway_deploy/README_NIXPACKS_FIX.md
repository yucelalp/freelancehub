# üîß Fixing Nixpacks Build Failure in Railway

If you're encountering a "Nixpacks build failed" error when deploying to Railway, follow these steps to resolve the issue.

## üö® Common Causes of Nixpacks Build Failures

1. **Incorrect Python version specification**
2. **Missing system dependencies**
3. **Improper pip installation commands**
4. **Conflicting package versions**
5. **Incorrect start command**

## ‚úÖ Solution 1: Updated Configuration Files

I've updated the following configuration files to fix the Nixpacks build issue:

### 1. Enhanced `nixpacks.toml`

```toml
[phases.setup]
aptPkgs = ["python3-dev", "build-essential", "python3-pip", "python3-venv", "libpq-dev"]

[phases.install]
cmds = ["python -m pip install --upgrade pip", "python -m pip install wheel", "python -m pip install -r requirements.txt"]

[start]
cmd = "gunicorn wsgi:app --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT --workers 1"

[phases]
providers = ["python"]

[variables]
PYTHON_VERSION = "3.9.16"
```

### 2. Enhanced `railway.json`

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://railway.app/railway.schema.json",
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS",
    "buildCommand": "python -m pip install --upgrade pip && python -m pip install wheel && python -m pip install -r requirements.txt"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "gunicorn wsgi:app --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT --workers 1",
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 10
  },
  "variables": {
    "PYTHON_VERSION": "3.9.16"
  }
}
```

## ‚úÖ Solution 2: Use Dockerfile Instead

If Nixpacks continues to fail, you can switch to using a Dockerfile:

1. In your Railway project, go to Settings
2. Change the Builder from "Nixpacks" to "Dockerfile"
3. Make sure the `Dockerfile` is in your repository root

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9.16-slim

WORKDIR /app

# Install system dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    python3-dev \
    build-essential \
    libpq-dev \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Copy requirements and install dependencies
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --upgrade pip && \
    pip install wheel && \
    pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy application code
COPY . .

# Create upload directory
RUN mkdir -p static/uploads

# Set environment variables
ENV PORT=8000
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1

# Expose port
EXPOSE 8000

# Run the application
CMD gunicorn wsgi:app --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT --workers 1
```

## üîç Checking Build Logs

To diagnose specific build failures:

1. Go to your Railway dashboard
2. Click on your deployment
3. Go to the "Logs" tab
4. Select "Build" from the dropdown
5. Look for specific error messages

## üöÄ Deployment Steps After Fixing

1. Push the updated configuration files to your GitHub repository
2. Go to Railway dashboard
3. Click "Deploy" on your project
4. Wait for the build and deployment to complete

## üîß Additional Troubleshooting

If you're still experiencing issues:

1. **Check Python Version**: Make sure you're using a supported Python version (3.9.x is recommended)
2. **Verify Dependencies**: Ensure all packages in requirements.txt are compatible
3. **Check Environment Variables**: Make sure all required environment variables are set in Railway
4. **Database Configuration**: If using a database, ensure connection strings are properly configured

## üéØ Testing Your Deployment

After successful deployment, test these features:

- User registration and login
- Browsing services
- Creating services (as a freelancer)
- Placing orders
- Payment system
- Real-time chat
- Notifications
